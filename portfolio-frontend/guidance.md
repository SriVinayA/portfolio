# Shrinking headder on scroll

A shrinking header on scroll is a common UI pattern where a fixed header element at the top of the page smoothly transitions to a smaller size as the user scrolls down. This effect is often used to maximize screen real estate for the main content while keeping essential navigation or branding elements accessible. With CSS scroll-driven animations, this effect can be achieved in a declarative and performant way, by linking an animation to the scroll position of the document.

## How to implement

Here’s how to create a shrinking header on scroll:

1.  **Create a fixed header:** Start with a header element that is fixed to the top of the page and has a predefined height.

    ```html
    <header>HEADER</header>
    ```

    ```css
    header {
      position: fixed;
      height: 200px;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
    }
    ```

2.  **Define the shrink animation:** Create a CSS animation that changes the height of the header.

    ```css
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        height: 50px;
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Apply the animation and scroll timeline:** Attach the animation to the header and use the `scroll()` function to link it to the document’s scroll position.

    ```css
    header {
      animation: shrink auto linear both;
      animation-timeline: scroll(block root);
    }
    ```

4.  **Set the `animation-range`:** Use the `animation-range` property to specify the scroll distance over which the animation should occur. For example, to shrink the header over the first 150 pixels of scrolling, you would use `animation-range: 0px 150px;`.

    ```css
    header {
      animation-range: 0px 150px;
    }
    ```

**Tip:** To prevent the content following the header from being obscured by it, add a `padding-top` to the `body` (or the main content container) that is equal to the initial height of the header.

**Tip:** To make sure the contents of the page scroll in sync with the shrinking header, set the `animation-range-end` to the difference between the start and end sizes. This ensures the animation completes precisely when the header reaches its final size. In this demo the header shrinks from `200px` to `50px`, so the `animation-range-end` is set to `150px`.

## Example code

```css
@keyframes shrink {
  to {
    height: 50px;
  }
}

header {
  animation: shrink auto linear both;
  animation-timeline: scroll(block root);
  animation-range: 0px 150px;
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: 0% 100%)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `scroll()` function to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the scroller: When not targeting the nearest ancestor scroller, be explicit about which scroller you want to use with `scroll(root)` or `scroll(self)`.
  - When `root`, `nearest`, or `self` are not sufficient, use a named scroll-timeline.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `scroll(block)` or `scroll(inline)`.

As for this use case specifically:

- The element that you animate **MUST** not be `position: static` or `position: relative` when using percentages in the `animation-range`.
  - This is because those elements are considered “in-flow”. Shrinking those elements as you scroll, would shrink the total scroll distance, thereby affecting the computed value of — for example — `10%` into the scroll.

## Browser support and fallback strategies

Scroll-driven animations has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 115 (Jul 2023), Edge 115 (Jul 2023), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.. Therefore, a fallback strategy is typically required.

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses a scroll listener to track the scroll position of the document over a distance of `150px` and updates the header's height accordingly.

```js
// Fallback for browsers that don't support scroll-driven animations
if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0% 100%)')) {
  const header = document.querySelector('header');

  const initialHeight = 200;
  const finalHeight = 50;
  const scrollDistance = 150;

  window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    const scrollY = window.scrollY;
    const scrollPercent = Math.min(1, scrollY / scrollDistance);
    const newHeight = initialHeight - (initialHeight - finalHeight) * scrollPercent;

    header.style.height = `${newHeight}px`;
  });
}
```

# Build a Parallax Effect on Scroll

A parallax effect on scroll is a visual technique where different layers of content move at varying speeds as the user scrolls down a page. This creates an illusion of depth, with foreground elements appearing to move faster than the background elements, resulting in an engaging and immersive browsing experience. This effect is best achieved using CSS Scroll-Driven Animations, which allow you to link animations to the scroll position of a container.

## How to implement

Here’s how to create a basic parallax effect:

1.  **Create a wrapper element:** This element simply groups all the layers of the parallax effect together. It is not the scrollable element, so its overflow should be clipped. Also give it a `height` that matches the height of one of the layers of the parallax effect.

    ```html
    <div class="wrapper">
      …
    </div>
    ```

    ```css
    .wrapper {
      overflow: clip;
      height: 100vh; /* Height of one of the layers of the parallax */
    }
    ```

2.  **Declare the layers:** Inside the wrapper, add the individual layers that will move at different speeds.

    ```html
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="layer">LAYER 0</div>
      <div class="layer">LAYER 1</div>
      <div class="layer">LAYER 2</div>
      …
    </div>
    ```

3.  **Add a translate animation:** Define a CSS animation that changes the `transform` property of the layers. For a parallax effect, you'll typically use `translateY` to move the layers vertically.

    ```css
    @keyframes parallax {
      from {
        transform: translateY(700px);
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Set up the `view-timeline`:** To link the animation to the scroll position, create a `view-timeline` on the wrapper element and then apply it to the layers.

    ```css
    .wrapper {
      view-timeline: --wrapper;
    }

    .layer {
      animation: parallax linear both;
      animation-timeline: --wrapper;
    }
    ```

5.  **Stagger the animations:** To make the layers move at different speeds, you can use one of two main approaches: **staggering in the keyframes**, or **staggering the `animation-range`**. 

    Both of these approaches can use hardcoded values, or can use the `sibling-index()`/`sibling-count()` implementation. The hardcoded values are easiest and also useful when having only a limited amount of layers. The `sibling-index()`/`sibling-count()` implementation is handy when you have many layers.

    *   **Staggering in the keyframes:**

        Using **hardcoded values**, you can define a custom property for each layer to manually control its parallax offset.

        ```css
        .layer:nth-child(1) { --offset: 100px; }
        .layer:nth-child(2) { --offset: 200px; }
        .layer:nth-child(3) { --offset: 300px; }

        @keyframes parallax {
          from {
            transform: translateY(var(--offset));
          }
        }
        ```

        Using **`sibling-index()`**, let the `sibling-index()` function return the index of a child element amongst its siblings to automatically calculate the staggered effect.

        ```css
        @keyframes parallax {
          from {
            transform: translateY(calc(100px * sibling-index()));
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **Staggering the `animation-range`:**

        Using **hardcoded values**, you can explicitly define the boundaries of the `animation-range` on each layer individually.

        ```css
        .layer:nth-child(1) { animation-range: entry 25% exit 50%; }
        .layer:nth-child(2) { animation-range: entry 25% exit 75%; }
        .layer:nth-child(3) { animation-range: entry 25% exit 100%; }
        ```

        Using **`sibling-index()` and `sibling-count()`**, you can calculate the range mathematically based on the total number of layers (`sibling-count()`).

        ```css
        .layer {
          animation-range: entry 25% exit calc(100% / sibling-count() * sibling-index());
        }
        ```

## Example code

```css
@keyframes parallax {
  from {
    transform: translateY(calc(100px * sibling-index()));
  }
}

.wrapper {
  view-timeline: --wrapper;
}

.layer {
  animation: parallax linear both;
  animation-timeline: --wrapper;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .layer {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `animation-range` property to achieve a similar effect:

```css
@keyframes parallax {
  from {
    transform: translateY(700px);
  }
}

.wrapper {
  view-timeline: --wrapper;
}

.layer {
  animation: parallax linear both;
  animation-timeline: --wrapper;
  animation-range: entry 25% exit calc(100% / sibling-count() * sibling-index());
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .layer {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: entry)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

As for setting the `animation-range`:

- **DO** give all layers the same start offset, e.g. `entry 25%`
- **DO** give all layers a different end offset that uses `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()` to distribute the offsets, e.g. `exit calc(100% / sibling-count() * sibling-index())`.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses an `IntersectionObserver` to track the visibility of the `.wrapper` element and updates the `transform` property of the layers based on the scroll position.

```js
// Fallback for browsers that don't support scroll-driven animations
if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)')) {
  const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper');
  const layers = document.querySelectorAll('.layer');

  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
      } else {
        window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
      }
    });
  }, { threshold: 0 });

  observer.observe(wrapper);

  function onScroll() {
    const scrollY = window.scrollY;
    const wrapperRect = wrapper.getBoundingClientRect();
    const wrapperTop = wrapperRect.top + scrollY;
    const wrapperHeight = wrapperRect.height;
    const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;

    if (scrollY >= wrapperTop - windowHeight && scrollY <= wrapperTop + wrapperHeight) {
      const scrollPercent = (scrollY - (wrapperTop - windowHeight)) / (wrapperHeight + windowHeight);
      
      layers.forEach((layer, index) => {
        // This matches the effect as defined in the CSS example above.
        // Customize this further if needed.
        const initialTranslateY = 100 * index;
        const translateY = initialTranslateY * (1 - scrollPercent);
        layer.style.transform = `translateY(${translateY}px)`;
      });
    }
  }

  // Trigger onScroll once to set initial positions
  onScroll();
}
```

# Add entry and exit effects to elements as they enter or exit the scrollport

Entry and exit effects are animations that are triggered when an element enters or leaves the viewport. This can be used to create engaging and dynamic user experiences. For example, you can use an entry effect to fade in an element as it scrolls into view, or an exit effect to scale it down as it scrolls out of view.

## How to implement

To add entry and exit effects to an element, you need to combine a few CSS properties. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Create separate `@keyframes` for the entry and exit animations.** The entry animation will be applied as the element enters the viewport, and the exit animation will be applied as it leaves.

    ```css
    @keyframes slide-in {
      from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
    }
    @keyframes slide-out {
      to { transform: translateX(100%); }
    }
    ```

2.  **Attach the entry and exit keyframes to the element.** You can do this by defining multiple animations in the `animation` property.

    -   Give the entry animation an `animation-fill-mode` of `backwards` so that it applies its initial state before the animation starts.
    -   Give the exit animation an `animation-fill-mode` of `forwards` so that it maintains its final state after the animation is complete.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation:
        slide-in 1s linear backwards,
        slide-out 1s linear forwards;
    }
    ```

3.  **Create a View Timeline and link it to the animations.** A View Timeline is a type of timeline that is linked to the visibility of an element in the viewport. You can create one using the `view()` function and then apply it to your animations using the `animation-timeline` property.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation-timeline: view();
    }
    ```

    By default, `view()` tracks the element on the `block` axis. If you need to track it on the `inline` axis, you can use `view(inline)`.

4.  **Limit the animations to the `entry` and `exit` ranges.** The `animation-range` property allows you to specify which part of the timeline an animation should run on.

    -   The `entry` range covers the time from when the element first enters the viewport until it is fully visible.
    -   The `exit` range covers the time from when the element starts to leave the viewport until it is completely hidden.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
    ```

## Example code

This code animates the direct children of the scroller on scroll using an **anonymous view-timeline**:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)) {
    @keyframes grow {
      from {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }

    .scroller > * {
      animation:
        grow auto linear backwards,
        shrink auto linear forwards;
      animation-timeline: view(inline);
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
  }
}
```

As the elements enter the scrollport the `grow` animation is played, and as they leave the scrollport the `shrink` animation is played.

The following code has the same visual outcome, but animates the direct children of the scroller on scroll using an **named view-timeline**:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)) {
    @keyframes grow {
      from {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }

    .scroller > * {
      view-timeline: --tl inline;
      animation:
        grow auto linear backwards,
        shrink auto linear forwards;
      animation-timeline: --tl;
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
  }
}
```

- When the animation is not applied to the tracked subject itself, use a named view timeline.

When using the `view-timeline` property to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **DO** use a CSS `<dashed-ident>` for the name.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view-timeline-axis`.
- **DO** make sure the scope of the lookup works: When the element that is declaring the `view-timeline` is not a flat tree ancestor of the animated element, hoist up the visibility of the `view-timeline`’s name by using `timeline-scope` on a shared ancestor.

Prefer a named `view-timeline` when multiple elements or children of the tracked subject need to animate.

--- Guide for carousel-snap-highlights ---
Scroll-state container queries allow you to style elements based on their current scroll state, such as whether an element is "stuck" (via sticky positioning) or "snapped" (via scroll snapping). This enables carousel or gallery experiences where the active item can be visually distinguished without relying on JavaScript intersection observers or scroll event listeners.

### Core implementation

To highlight snapped items, you must establish a scroll-snap container, define the snap targets as scroll-state containers, and then query that state to style descendants.

#### 1. Establish the scroll snap container
The parent container must have `scroll-snap-type` enabled.

```html
<div class="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-item">
    <div class="card">Product 1 content</div>
  </div>
  <div class="carousel-item">
    <div class="card">Product 2 content</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.carousel {
  display: flex;
  overflow-x: auto;
  /* MANDATORY: Enable scroll snapping on the container */
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}
```

#### 2. Define snap targets as scroll-state containers
Each item in the carousel that should be tracked for snapping must be declared as a `scroll-state` container.

```css
.carousel-item {
  /* Define where the item snaps within the container */
  scroll-snap-align: center;
  
  /* MANDATORY: Establish this element as a scroll-state query container */
  container-type: scroll-state;
}
```

#### 3. Query the `snapped` state

Because container queries style **descendants**, you must apply the highlight styles to an element *inside* the snap target.  Because the scroll container is set to overflow on the x axis, use the `scroll-state(snapped: x)` query.

**MANDATORY**: Wrap the styles in ` @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` to only show the effect to users who have not requested reduced motion. Depending on your use case, you may retain portions of the effect, but in this case, the cards flash from white to blue in a way that may cause problems for some users, so we disable it completely.

```css
/* Specify transition outside of queries so that it is applied regardless of state.  */
.card {
  transition:
    scale 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1),
    background-color 0.4s,
    color 0.4s,
    box-shadow 0.4s;
}
/* 
Only show the effect for users not requesting reduced motion. Disable completely, including the color change, as it causes a flash that may be problematic.
*/
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  /* Style the content when its parent .carousel-item is snapped on the x axis */
  @container scroll-state(snapped: x) {
    .card {
      background: #007bff;
      color: white;
      scale: 1.15;
      box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.3);
    }
  }
}

/* MANDATORY Copy-Paste Safety: Disable highlight scaling/flashing for motion sensitive users */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card {
    transition: none !important;
    scale: 1 !important;
  }
}
```

The `snapped` descriptor can query specific axes: `x`, `y`, `inline`, `block`, or `both`.


### Accessibility

**AVOID**: using `scroll-state` with interactive elements.

Visual highlights for snapped items can improve the UX, but the snapped item is not exposed to the accessibility tree. The visual theme applied to a snapped item should not convey that the element is active or focused, and a keyboard focus ring should be highly visible and distinct from the `snapped` highlight. If the snapped item is interactive, you must use other standard accessibility practices to make it accessible.  

Snapping occurs due to scrolling, which does not move keyboard focus. However, keyboard focus may cause the scroll container to move, causing a change in the snapped item, which may or may not be the focused item. This will likely be a source of confusion for users and is discouraged.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed accessibility requirements for carousels (such as ARIA roles, slide attributes, and complex keyboard patterns) have been intentionally omitted from this guide. Carousel accessibility is highly nuanced and context-dependent; refer to established accessibility standards and perform thorough user testing for production environments.


## Fallback strategies

Container scroll-state queries has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 133 (Feb 2025) and Edge 133 (Feb 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

For browsers that do not support scroll-state queries, you should provide a functional base experience where all items are legible, even without the "active" highlight.

#### Feature detection
You can use `@supports` to provide enhancements only to supported browsers:

```css
@supports (container-type: scroll-state) {
  /* Enhancement styles here */
}
```

#### JavaScript fallback

If the highlight is critical for the user experience, use `IntersectionObserver` to determine the snapped item. Adjust the observed area to a thin slice in the center of the carousel by providing a `rootMargin` with a negative inline value. For example, to consider an element to be intersecting if it is in the center 2% of the carousel, set the `rootMargin` to `"0px -49%"`.  

```javascript
// Optional: detect support and apply a JS-based fallback
if (!CSS.supports('container-type', 'scroll-state')) {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      // Toggle a class based on intersection
      entry.target.classList.toggle('is-snapped', entry.isIntersecting);
    });
  }, {
    root: document.querySelector(".carousel"),
    // Carousel item intersects if any part of the carousel item is in the middle 2% of the carousel.
    rootMargin: "0px -49%"
  });

  document.querySelectorAll('.carousel-item').forEach(item => {
    observer.observe(item);
  });
}
```


--- Guide for scrollability-affordance-hints ---
## Overview

Visual hints, like shadows or gradients, help users understand that they can scroll to see more content. This guide shows how to build these hints using CSS `container-scroll-state-queries`, which allows styling elements based on the scrollable state of their container without relying on JavaScript scroll listeners or observers.

## Implementation

### 1. Establish the Scroll Container

The scroll container must be declared as a scroll-state query container.

```css
.scroller {
  overflow-y: auto;
  /* Establish this element as a scroll-state query container */
  container-type: scroll-state;
  position: relative;
}
```

### 2. Style the Indicators

Place the indicator elements (like shadows, gradients, or arrows) inside the container and style them. By default, they should not be visible. When they are shown, they should not be interactive, by setting `pointer-events: none`.

```css
.indicator-top, .indicator-bottom {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 20px;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.2s;
  pointer-events: none; /* Let clicks pass through */
}

.indicator-top {
  top: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0.2), transparent); /* Example: Shadow */
}

.indicator-bottom {
  bottom: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0,0,0,0.2), transparent); /* Example: Shadow */
}
```

### 3. Query the Scroll State

Use the `@container` rule with the `scroll-state` function. Check if the container is scrollable up or down to show the respective indicator.

```css
/* Show top indicator when the user can scroll up */
@container scroll-state(scrollable: top) {
  .indicator-top {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/* Show bottom indicator when the user can scroll down */
@container scroll-state(scrollable: bottom) {
  .indicator-bottom {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

## Fallback strategies

Container scroll-state queries has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 133 (Feb 2025) and Edge 133 (Feb 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

### Basic Fallback
If the feature is not supported, the indicators will remain invisible. Since these are hints and not critical for functionality, it is acceptable to omit them in unsupported browsers.

### Advanced Fallback (Intersection Observer)
If the hints are required, use an `IntersectionObserver` to toggle classes when sentinel elements at the top and bottom of the scroller move in and out of the scrollport.

```html
<!-- Sentinel elements placed at the ends of the scroller -->
<div class="sentinel-top"></div>
<!-- Content goes here -->
<div class="sentinel-bottom"></div>
```

```css
/* Marker styling to ensure it does not affect layout */
.sentinel-top, .sentinel-bottom {
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
}

.scroller.scrolled-down .indicator-top {
  opacity: 1;
}

.scroller.can-scroll-down .indicator-bottom {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

```javascript
if (!CSS.supports('container-type', 'scroll-state')) {
  const topSentinel = document.querySelector('.sentinel-top');
  const bottomSentinel = document.querySelector('.sentinel-bottom');
  const scroller = document.querySelector('.scroller');

  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.target === topSentinel) {
        // If top sentinel is not intersecting, we have scrolled down
        scroller.classList.toggle('scrolled-down', !entry.isIntersecting);
      }
      if (entry.target === bottomSentinel) {
        // If bottom sentinel is intersecting, we reached the bottom
        scroller.classList.toggle('can-scroll-down', !entry.isIntersecting);
      }
    });
  }, { root: scroller });

  observer.observe(topSentinel);
  observer.observe(bottomSentinel);
}
```
