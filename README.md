## 🛠️ Running Locally

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js v20+
*   Java 21
*   A DeepSeek API Key (API cost is cheap :))

### 1. Start the Backend
The backend serves the AI chatbot. You must provide a DeepSeek API key. By default, AI responses are capped at 600 output tokens.

```bash
cd portfolio-backend
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
./gradlew bootRun
```
*The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.*

### 2. Start the Frontend
The frontend uses Vite and expects the backend to be running on port 8080 by default.

```bash
cd portfolio-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
*The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.*

## ☁️ Deployment

This repository is configured for automated, free-tier deployments.

### Backend (Google Cloud Run)
A GitHub Actions workflow is included to automate the Java 21 build and deployment to Google Cloud Run.
1. Create a Google Cloud Project and enable the Cloud Run API.
2. Set up GitHub Repository Secrets for `GCP_CREDENTIALS` (your service account JSON) and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
3. Pushing to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the `.github/workflows/deploy-portfolio-backend.yml` action to deploy your service.

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the Root Directory to `portfolio-frontend`.
3. Add a `VITE_CHAT_API_URL` environment variable pointing to your Cloud Run backend URL (e.g., `https://portfolio-backend-xxxxxx.a.run.app`).
